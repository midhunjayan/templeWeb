                  <p>The most important festival of the temple is ‘Ekadasi Vilakku’, coinciding with the Guruvayoor Ekadasi. The Devaprasnam here done now a days show that the temple gets the position and purity of a great temple. Thus decided to conduct
                    an 8-day festival including Ankurarpanam, Pallivetta etc. that are the main highlighting functions of a great temple. So progressing fluctuations are done in the daily poojas and rules.

                  <h2>Sathram</h2>
                  <p>The first Akhila Bharatha Sreemad Bhagavatha Sathram was dedicated at Poothrukkovil Temple 25 years ago. This silver jubilee year the same is once again scheduled to be conducted from 23rd to 30th December 2007 at Kurichithanam Poothrukkovil
                    Temple. Unlike ‘Sapthaham’ or Navaham, Sathram dedicates only to the extracts of Bhagavatham, recited and explained in the most divine concept coinciding with the contemporary frame-of-mind of the people of ‘Kaliyug’.
                  </p>
                  <p>Ages behind, when Acharyas desired to propagate the doctrines of Bhagavatham, and sought for a suitable place to recite the same. Lord Krishna rolled off an iron ball (Nemi) and asked to recite the bhagavatham at the place where nemi
                    reduces to earth on the banks of ‘Ganga’ , which is now known as ‘Naimisharanyam’, (Nimisar) in Uttar Pradesh. One of the holy texts of Bhagavatham which is being recited at Naimisharnyam is already brought to Sree Padmanabha Temple,
                    Thiruvananthapuram. This will be the Bhagavatham, scheduled to be recited at the Sathravedi from 24.12.2007 by renowned Acharyas. The same will be transported in ‘Grandharatham’ accepting receptions at more than 75 temples on the way
                    to Kurichithanam Poothrukkovil Temple. The idol of Lord Krishna which is to be worshipped at the ‘Sathravedi’ , is scheduled to be brought from Uduppi Sreekrishna Temple by ‘Vaishnavaratham’ covering 101 temples on the way. The ‘Dhwajaratham’
                    (One which is carrying the holy flag and flagpole) is scheduled to be brought from Harippad Subrahmanya Temple covering more than 25 temples. All the three chariots will assemble at Sathravedi on 23rd December 2007 being escorted by
                    hundreds on small chariots from various temples at and around Kurichithanam village. The devotees , during ‘Sathram’ will be the audience for recitals and discourses by Acharyas and religious scholars. The silver jubilee of Akhila
                    Bharatha Sreemad Bhagavatha Sathram will be dedicated at Poothrukkovil Temple premises in the month of December 2007 .To be exactly from the 23rd of December to the 30th of December 2007.
                  </p>
                  <p>It was at the same holy soil in 1983 that the first “Satharam” was also dedicated. 24 long years have elapsed and as another godsend, the Akhila Bharatha Sreemad Bhagavatha Sathram has returned to its birth place just to shower blessing
                    to thronging devotees on its SILVER JUBILEE YEAR. Sreemad Bhagavatha Sathram had begun years back on the banks on the holy river Ganga , and that devine spot was known as “NAIMISARANYAM”. The purpose of that Sathram , as advised by
                    “Brahma” was to relieve the devotes from the evils of Kaliyuga. We live in the kaliyuga. We are pluged by ill thought, enmity, vengeance andegoism. By listening the holy recitals and discourses of eminent Scholars and Acharya, the
                    sins of a life time can be washed off. Here lies the significance of Sreemad Bhagavatha Sathram.</p>
                  <p>“Sreemad Bhagavatha Sathram “is one of the rarest of the rare occasion to hear and hark the discussions , deliberations and discourses on the percepts of “Bhagavatham” by learned Rishis, Priests and Scholars.</p>
                  <p>Bhagavatha Sathram gives us an opportunity to bathe in the intense and infinite bliss of Lord who directly walks in to the venue. The gracious presence of the Omnipotent, Omnipresent and Omniscient Sree Guruvayoorappan and Sree Poothrukkovilappan
                    dissolves us in internal devotion and emancipate us from all terrestrial torments. Bhagavatha Sathram is an amalgam of four “Yejnas” viz:(1). Recitation of Sreemad Bhagavatham by eminent Acharyas , (2). Authentic speeches on various
                    precepts wombed in Bhagavatham by profound scholars. (3). ‘Naamajapam and (4).Annadanam. Each day poojas and archanas are consecrated on the Sathravedi by revered and renounced “Thantris”. Devotees and inquisitive minds throng from
                    walks of life on these divine dates and let you be one among them. Only physical and fiscal input can render this noble Endeavour a reality. We solicit your participation and patronage by all the ways and means and for which there
                    is no leaps and bounds.</p>

                  <h2>Sapthaham</h2>
                  <p>Shrimad Bhagavatham is a sacred text rendered by Sage Veda Vyasa. Despite the fact that Veda Vyasa passed on the Vedas, the Puranas and the Mahabharatha to his disciples he felt a void in his heart. To fill this void, he was initiated
                    by sage Narada into doing a Bhakthi Grantha (devotional scripture) on lord Krishna, namely, Shrimad Bhagavatham. Though Sage Veda Vyasa passed on theVedas, the Puranas and the Mahabharatha to his disciples he kept Shrimad Bhagavatham,
                    the greatest treasure, to himself, as he felt that the recipient had to be of the highest order. And so it was later given to none other than his own son - Brahma Jnani (man of supreme knowledge) Sri Shuka. The Bhagavatham that we
                    read is the one that Sri Shuka narrated to King Parikshith (son of Abhimanyu and the grandson of Arjuna) on the banks of the Holy Ganges for seven days. Just listening to the narration of Bhagavatham took Parikshith to eternity. Such
                    is the greatness of this text. It is said that, "Shrimad Bhagavathaakhyoyam Prathyaksha Krishnavahai" Bhagavatha Sapthaham is conducted regularly during Vaisagham of every year .This too was initiated by Bhagavatha Hamsam Brahmasree
                    Malliyoor.
